Title: API translator

Files

translator_funcs.py - contains classes that are essential for the working of the program

translator_main.py - pieces all together and displays the whole thing

trainslator_main.exe - exe file made by pyinstall package

Description of the project

The goal of the project is to create Word file translator(*.docx or *.doc). The profit of this program, compared to usual google translator is that it keeps the formating: you won't need to change layout, aligning, text color and etc

Notes: *Won't launch on Windows 7 and older, due to missing api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll, which is only implemented in Windows 8
* *.exe file might not work due to API limitations

How to launch

Launch trainslator_main.exe, you do not need any other files!
